<h1>How to Integrate New Instruments into VideoRay Cockpit</h1>
<p>
To put the new instrument into Cockpit, you will need a
flash-drive or some other way (email) to get the .dll file
from your local computer to the integrated control box's laptop. The .dll is all you will need to have your instrument running. There are a couple of locations where this can be found. For the Ribbon Compass example:<br>
<ol>
<li>Open Windows Explorer</li>
<li>Navigate to the "IntrumentHostSample" folder</li>
<li>Continue to navigate along the path "\Ribbon\obj\Debug"</li>
<li>Copy the RibbonCopmass.dll file onto your flash drive</li>
</ol>
<br>
Regardless if using email or a flash drive, just get the .dll
file to the integrated control box's laptop.  Once the .dll file is on the laptop:
 <ol>
<li>Open the laptop's Windows Explorer</li>
<li>Navigate to the "C:\ProgramFiles(x86)\VideoRay\vrCockpit\Instruments" folder</li>
<li>Copy the RibbonCopmass.dll file into this location</li>
<li>Close Windows Explorer</li>
<li>Run Cockpit</li>
</ol>
At this point the instrument should be running. A common mistake is setting the size of the instrument too small so that it is hard to see. The size of the instrument can be altered in either its <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost/out/instrument_example/html/x_start.html" >xaml</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost/out/instrument_example/html/c_coding.html" >xaml.cs</a> file. Another area to try diagnosing if the the instrument does not show is to go to the <a target="_blank" href="http://vrweb/pro_4/html/settings_instruments_display.html" >Instruments Display</a> and see if the instrument is unselected.
