<h1>How to integrate new Instruments into VideoRay Cockpit</h1>
<p>
To put the new instrument onto Cockpit, you will need a
flash-drive or some other way (email) to get the .dll file
from your local computer to the integrated control box's laptop.
  The .dll is all you 
will need to have your instrument running. There are a couple 
of locations where this can be found. For the Ribbon Compass
example:<br>
<ol>
<li>Open Window's Explorer</li>
<li>Navigate to the "IntrumentHostSample" folder</li>
<li>Continue to navigate along the path \Ribbon\obj\Debug</li>
<li>Copy the RibbonCopmass.dll file onto your flash drive</li>
</ol>
<br>
Regardless if using email or a flash drive, just get the .dll
file to the integrated control box's laptop.  Once the .dll file 
is on the laptop:
 <ol>
<li>Open the laptop's Windows Explorer</li>
<li>Navigate to the "C:\Program Files(x86)\VideoRay\vrCockpit\Instruments" 
folder</li>
<li>Copy the RibbonCopmass.dll file into this location</li>
<li>Close Windows Explorer</li>
<li>Run Cockpit</li>
</ol>
At this point the instrument should be running. A common mistake
is setting the size of the instrument too small so that it is 
hard to see. The size of the instrument can be altered in either 
its xaml or xaml.cs file.
