 <h1>Testing Environment</h1>
These procedures describe how to get the RibbonCompass 
project running within the "vrInstrumentHostSample" test
solution and how to edit testable parameters. This 
Solution was provided as a simple testing simulation. 
Its current configuration is set to alter just the 
Yaw parameter, but it can be easily modified to change 
a breath of settings to mimic the real system.
