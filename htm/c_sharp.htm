<h1>Coding in C#</h1>
<p>
This section goes over steps needed to successfully code and 
manipulate the C# code associated with the Ribbon Compass
Project. 
</p>
<h1>Opening the C# Code</h1>
<p>
To access the .xaml.cs file &#40;.cs is the extention for C# files&#41;:
<ol>
<li>Go to the "Solution Explorer"</li>
<li>Expand your project, for the example this is called 
 "RibbonCompass" </li>
<li>Expand your .xaml file, for the example this is 
 called "RibbonCompass.xaml" </li>
 <li>Double click on the .cs file, for the example it
 would be called "RibbonCompass.xaml.cs" </li>
  <img src="/../../instrument_example/images/ribbonCompass_c.jpg" name= "picture1">
 </ol>
</p>
<h1>Editing C# Code</h1>
<p>
The best way to get the C# is either:
<ol>
<li>Deleting everything then copying and pasting the correct 
code in</li>
<li>Try adding the correct code from the code to follow</li>
</ol>
<br>
The declarations at the top of the C# file tell the
file which class it should utilize.  
The declarations at the top of the code are:
  <img src="/../../instrument_example/images/c_top.jpg" name= "picture2">
<br>
The rest of the code, covered in the next section, looks like:
<img src="/../../instrument_example/images/c_bot.jpg" name= "picture3" width="660">
