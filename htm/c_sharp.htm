<h1>Coding in C#</h1>
<p>
This section goes over steps needed to successfully code and 
manipulate the C# code associated with the Instrument. 
</p>
<h1>Opening the C# Code</h1>
<p>
To access the .xaml.cs file &#40;.cs is the extention for C# files&#41;:
<ol>
<li>Go to the "Solution Explorer"</li>
<li>Expand your project (for the example this is called 
 "RibbonCompass") </li>
<li>Expand your .xaml file (for the example this is 
 called "RibbonCompass.xaml")</li>
 <li>Double click on the .cs file (for the example it
 would be called "RibbonCompass.xaml.cs") </li>

 </ol>
</p>
<h1>Editing C# Code</h1>
<p>
The best way to get the C# is either:
<ol>
<li>Deleting everything then copying and pasting the correct 
code in</li>
<li>Try adding the correct code from the code to follow</li>
</ol>
<br>
The declarations at the top of the C# file tell the
file which class it should utilize. This list of declarations below are a minimum for anyone who is making their own instrument.  A omission one can make is eliminating the System.Windows.Navigation  if navigation is not being utilized.  The parameters of the project are going to determine which declarations need to be made, but what is below will cover the basics such as using shapes.
The declarations at the top of the code are:<br>

The rest of the code used in the Ribbon Compass example is shown below. Some part of the code are required for all C# codes for all Instruments and some are specific to the example. The next sectioj
