<h1>Fill Property and ImageBrush Class</h1>
<p>
Fill is a property that gets or sets the Brush that specifies the shape&rsquo;s ( used with the rectangle class in the example) interior. A color is therefore a valid value for the fill property.  ImageBrush is also a valid value for the fill property.  ImageBrush takes an image and paints it on the specific shape. For more information on the Fill property click

  <h1>ImageSource</h1>
<p>
ImageSource specifies where the image is coming 
from for the ImageBrush.  The path of the image 
can be from any folder on the computer, with the 
correct path. Without a "C:" or likewise prefix, 
the folder path assumes that it starts at the Project&rsquo;s 
name&rsquo;s folder. So in the example&rsquo;s case 
"InstrumentHostSample".

    <h1>How to Make an Image a Resource</h1>
<p>
The examples makes a .png file a resource, so it 
can be referenced from any computer and not have 
to be hard coded.  For the example, an image made 
in paint was used as the image to be brushed onto 
the rectangle.  The png file was of made from 24 
equal parts each to represent 45 degrees.  45*24= 
1080.  The width of the rectangle was conveniently 
set to 1080, the width for viewing was set to 360 
(Before the first  &lt;Grid&gt; or &lt;Canvas&gt; is invoked) 
and the rectangle was set to the right by 417 so 
that the examples image would originally set with 
North in the viewable center. To add a .png or .jpg file 
as a resource:
