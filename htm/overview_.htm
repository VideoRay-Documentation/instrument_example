This document goes over the process used to create an instrument for VideoRay's Cockpit.  To help demonstrate some of the concepts an example instrument, Ribbon Compass, will be commented on throughout the document. Instruments are designed to provide feedback and control for the user.

The Ribbon Compass Instrument will appear as the image below. The instrument is a combination of 12 different shapes and text blocks within Visual Studio.  The function of the Ribbon Compass is to display the heading of the ROV in a simple format where the compass background moves while the middle arrows stay stationary. The background is dependent on the value of the heading. The view displayed by the Ribbon is 130 degrees left to right.  The actual range of the camera, 98 degrees, marked off by the yellow lines. The middle white and red triangles are the compass arrows mark the actual heading of the compass.  The number display shows the heading of the ROV in a digital format. A future improvement that can be developed is to enable the Ribbon Compass to set the Auto Heading.
