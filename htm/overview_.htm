This document goes over the process used to create an instrument for VideoRay's Cockpit.  To help demonstrate some of the concepts an example instrument, Ribbon Compass, will be commented on throughout the document. Instruments are designed to provide feedback and control for the user.

The Ribbon Compass Instrument looks like the image below. The instrument is a combination of 12 different shapes and text blocks within Visual Studio.  The function of the Ribbon Compass is to display the heading of the ROV in a simple format where the compass background moves as dependent on the value of the heading. The view displayed by the Ribbon is 130 degrees, with the actual range of the camera, 98 degrees, marked off by the yellow lines. The middle white and red triangles mark the actual heading of the compass.  The number display shows the digital heading of the ribbon compass.
