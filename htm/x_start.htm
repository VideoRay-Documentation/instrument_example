<h1>Starting the XAML coding</h1>

<p>
This section will begin with renaming your XAML
 file and other first steps.
<br>
To rename your file:
<ol> <!--"--> 
<li>In "Solution Explorer" expand your Project
 (RibbonCompass)</li>
<li>Right click on "MainWindow.xaml"  </li>
<li>Select Rename</li>
<li>Type in the highlighted area "RibbonCompass"</li>
 </ol>
For the rest of the set up:
<ol> <!--"--> 
<li>In "Solution Explorer" expand your Project
 (RibbonCompass) </li>
<li>Double click on "RibbonCompass.xaml"</li>
<li>The XAML and Design Window are now open.
 In the XAML window is where simple coding is done
 and the Design window displays what it will look like.
 Edit the XAML window to read:</li>
 </ol>
<img src="/../../instrument_example/images/XamlTop.jpg" name= "picture" width="660">

Between the "Canvas" class is where one begins to write
 their code. The "Canvas" class defines an area within
 which you can explicitly position child objects, using
 coordinates that are relative to the Canvas area.
 Important to note: Height="10" Width="100" are the
 dimensions visible once the instrument is running.
