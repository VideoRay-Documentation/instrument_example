<h1>Starting the XAML coding</h1>

<p>
In the XAML window is where simple coding is done
 and the Designer window displays what it will look like. For more overview of what the Designer provides click  <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh921077.aspx">here</a>.

This section will continue with renaming your XAML
 file and other first steps.
 
<br><br>
To rename your file:
<ol> <!--"--> 
<li>In "Solution Explorer" expand "Your Instrument's name" project</li>
<li>Right click on "MainWindow.xaml"  </li>
<li>Select Rename</li>
<li>Type in the highlighted area "Your Instrument's name"</li>
 </ol>
For the rest of the set up:
<ol> <!--"--> 
<li>In "Solution Explorer" expand "Your Instrument's name"  </li>
<li>Double click on ""Your Instrument's name".xaml"</li>
<li>The XAML and Design Window are now open.
 Edit the XAML window to read (Substitute "Your Instrument's name" for "RibbonCompass" on the first line):</li>
 </ol>

Between the "Canvas" class is where one begins to write
 their code. The "Canvas" class defines an area within
 which you can explicitly position child objects, using
 coordinates that are relative to the Canvas area.
 Important to note: Height="10" Width="100" are the
 dimensions visible once the instrument is running. The  dimensions shown in Cockpit can be altered by the C# code, but the Height and Width located here are what show in the Designer window.
