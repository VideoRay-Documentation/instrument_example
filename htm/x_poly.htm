<h1>The Polygon Class</h1>
<p>
The polygon is a class which can be made into 
many shapes. The Points= "" part of the code specifies where the polygon&rsquo;s points are, so 6 point makes a hexagon and so on. The coder is free to
utilize as many points as needed to get the job done.  The Opacity property sets how transparent the shape is, a 1 being no transparency and a 0 being full transparency. Click <a target="_blank" href="../../instrument_example/html/x_rect.html">here</a>
to learn about the already covered x:Name and Left properties .

The part of the Ribbon Compass example 
which uses polygon is shown below:

 In the example triangles are created since there are only three points specified. The Fill property as demonstrated with the example Fill= "Red " is to be given a color as its value. The color specified is what color the polygon will be.
