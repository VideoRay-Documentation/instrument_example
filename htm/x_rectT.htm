<h1>Rectangle RenderTransform & TranslateTransform </h1>
<p>
RenderTransform gets or sets transform information 
that affects the rendering position of this element. 
This is a dependency property. TranslateTransform 
sets the placement to which to move the object (in 
the example&rsquo;s case a rectangle) along an axis (in 
the example&rsquo;s case X) from the fixed origin.  The x:Name="" allows the C# files to interact with it since it has a name.  The X="" sets the initial X axis 
displacement from the origin. <br>

<br>In the example the C# code interacts and 
and changes the X value. The Yaw property in the C# is the value that X is set to.  Yaw is from 0 to 359 and the C# code will move the rectangle 1 position to the left for every increment in degree. So 90 degrees moves the rectangle 90 positions to the left and making the compass needle appear over East (having moved right from North). Since Yaw only goes up to 359, the same 360 positions are used infinitely. <br>

<br> If you wanted to move something along the Y axis you would just change the X to a Y. For more information on the RenderTransform Property click
